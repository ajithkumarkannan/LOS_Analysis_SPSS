**Comparative Analysis of Length of Stay in Neurology, Cardiology, and Endocrinology Facilities**

**Overview**

Length of Stay (LOS) is a critical metric in healthcare, influencing hospital resource utilization and patient care quality. This study analyzes LOS across Cardiology, Neurology, and Endocrinology facilities using SPSS statistical methods to identify variations and key influencing factors.

**Abstract**

Hospital Length of Stay (LOS) varies by department and is affected by multiple factors, including patient conditions and hospital processes. This study examines 120 patient records (40 per facility) and applies Kruskal-Wallis tests to assess differences in LOS. The findings indicate a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001), with Cardiology having the longest average LOS (7.05 days) and Endocrinology the shortest (3.68 days).

**Methods**

Dataset: 120 patient records across three specialties (Cardiology, Neurology, Endocrinology).
Statistical Tests Used: ANOVA & Kruskal-Wallis (for non-parametric data).
Tools: SPSS for statistical analysis, Excel for initial data preparation.
Key Variables: LOS, Department, Patient Condition.

**Results & Discussion**

Cardiology had the longest LOS due to higher complexity cases and prolonged treatment protocols.
Endocrinology had the shortest LOS, likely due to more predictable and routine treatment paths.
Significant differences suggest that departmental resource allocation and discharge planning need optimization.

**Technologies Used**

SPSS for statistical analysis
Microsoft Excel for data preprocessing
Kruskal-Wallis test for significance testing

**How to Reproduce the Analysis**

Open the provided SPSS syntax files (.spv).
Load a dataset (.sav) structured with LOS as the dependent variable and Department as the categorical independent variable.
Run Kruskal-Wallis test to verify significance.
